-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss on Monday morning.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
done
The data structure you plan to use.
  1.) I plan to use an array or 2D array as the data structure to record the user's moves.
  2.) I plan to use jQuery for creating click event handlers for the gameboard, login features,
  and game preferences(create game, update game, find game).

How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  1.) The gameBoard in JS will be represented as an array. Similar to Boggle.


How you plan to approach this project. (Test Every Step of Code I Type)
  1.)  Read API Docs.
  2.)  Use the wireframe as my layout.
  3.)  Create Skeleton (HTML) / the layout with proper class names according to
  API Docs for forms.
  4.)  Position Div elements with CSS
  5.)  Create Curl Request scripts to test to the API.
  6.)  Create the HTTP ajax methods listed in order by the API Docs.
  7.)  Create Event Handlers that work along with ajax.
  8.)  Create the UI Js that will create the actions listed in the API Doc.
  9.)  Once game works, then begin adding CSS styling for the fonts, colors, etc.


4-8 user stories for your game project.

1.) As a user, I want to sign-up so that I can sign-in for future games.
2.) As a user, I want to play matches with others so that each game will be different.
3.) As a user, I want to click on a gameboard so that I can choose my move.
4.) As a user, I want to play a game so that I can have fun
5.) As a user, I want lives so that I can have multiple chances to beat my opponent
6.) As a user, I want online-matches, so that I can play with other users.
7.) As a developer, I want to test my code so that I avoid errors in the game.


How you plan to keep your code moodular.
- I would like to use the same template that we have been using from class.

What creative spin will you add to your project.

- Each user will have a ranking(with a different API).
- You level up and receive badges for each of your victories.
- You gain exp points based on the person's ranking (with a different API).
- You will be able to sign up with a 3rd party API, like Facebook or Gmail.
- You can switch your avatar picture.
- There are little hearts that act as your lives.

How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
I plan to use version control to save my updates on a branch separate from the master branch.
The master branch will only represent the working code.

Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
  My focus is on making the game to work. Bonuses will come as enhancements
  for me to work on the side for portfolio prep.
